## clisyntax


#### Purpose and goal of the program

Syntax Reference command line program

BAREbones syntax structure available from the command line with only a single command string. You know how to use the structures and what they do, you just can't remember the syntactic details! clisyntax is your tool to coding in less-than-familiar programming languages!

This program will be an easy and quick way to clarify or learn the syntax of a given programming language. 
The dream is that, say for instance, if you were writing lisp code, you could type something like: "clisyntax lisp case-statement" and you would be given a statement supplying the basic syntax of case statements in lisp, a --verbose double flag option explained any nuances in lisp case statements as they might differ from other prog langauges, and you that you would also have the option, with a double or single flag argument, to increase or decrease the amount of information that you would like in addition to the syntactical information that you queried for.

Development of CLI program providing quick access to syntactic information in a given programming language
Languages to be supported by cliSyntax (in the following order):

    Python (3.9)
    JavaScript
    C (Ansi standard)
    LISP (common Lisp)
    Java
    Ruby
    More to follow

first languages to be added

    first supported language: LISP (common lisp)
    second two languages to be added are python and javascript, and then C (standard ansi)



syntax terms to be supported (more terms and concepts inevitably to follow:
The following terms will yield the most common way to write them
(-v flag will print all documentation and all available legal syntax forms of that struction in desired language)

Basic language classification

For loops

While Loops (while and until statements)

Case statements

If, else if, if else, else statements

Basic arithmetic operators (by typing "operators" as syntax option)

Standard library functions

Language keywords
