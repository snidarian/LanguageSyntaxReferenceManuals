## clisyntax


#### Purpose and goal of the program

This program will be an easy and quick way to clarify or learn the syntax of a given programming language. 
The dream is that, say for instance, if you were writing lisp code, you could type something like: "clisyntax lisp case-statement" and you would be given a statement that gave the basic syntax of case statements in lisp, explained any nuances in lisp case statements as they might differ from other prog langauges, and you that you would also have the option, with a double or single flag argument, to increase or decrease the amount of information that you would like in addition to the syntactical information that you queried for.
